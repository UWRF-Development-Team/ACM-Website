        <h1>Need help? We've got you!</h1>
        <p>
            Campus life is hard... And sometimes, so is getting help.<br>
            We at UWRF ACM are willing to help with any CIDS related issues!
        </p>
        <h3>How do I get help?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Walk in! If the ACM door (South Hall 21) is open, feel free to come in and ask any questions about your courses.<br>
                While we aren't accredited by the university, we will help the best we can and point you in a better direction if not.
            </li>
            <li>
                Access tutoring services! UWRF has tutoring services available, and most people find them very helpful.<br>

                We understand that sometimes you need help in a different way. We're just students, and we can't help in every way.<br>
                If needed, please access the counseling services <a href="https://students.uwrf.edu/student-health-counseling/counseling-services">here.</a><br>
